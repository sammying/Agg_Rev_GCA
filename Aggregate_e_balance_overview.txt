Electron and mass balance for aggregates (GCA review response)

Lactate --> Acetate = 4 electron transfer to terminal e acceptors as follows

Ferrihydrite reduction by lactate:
4Fe(OH)3 + C3H5O3- + 7H+ --> 4Fe2+ + CH3COO- + HCO3- + 10H2O

Birnessite reduction by lactate:
2MnO2 + C3H5O3- + 3H+ --> 4Mn2+ + CH3COO- + HCO3- + 2H2O

Arsenate reduction by lactate:
2H2AsO42- + C3H5O3- + 3H+ --> 2H3AsO3 + CH3COO- + HCO3-

O2 reduction by lactate:
2O2 + C3H5O3- --> CH3COO- + HCO3- + H+

Total number of mols of lactate available at all times:
We have approximately 2.8 mM lactate influent at all times.
Effluent lactate and acetate vary immensely over time.

1. Add up the total number of electrons transferred by summing the concentration of As(III), Fe(II), and Mn(II) from ICP data
2. Assume volume as 1 L to make all mM and uM into mmol and mol mass
